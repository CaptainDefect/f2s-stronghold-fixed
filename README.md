# f2s-stronghold-fixed

Whats wrong with it and why fix it?

Stronghold was a game creating by RoaringCow who as far as I'm aware has vanished off the surface of the planet.

The gamemode was left in its state and many of the features that relied on RoaringCows website through HTTP requests(to verify bans, versions, the help menu) remained broken.

Stronghold is personally one of my favorite Garry's Mod gamemodes and when I created my variety server and discovered how ruined the Workshop version was(the only public existing copy), I was disappointed and took it upon myself it fix it.

I plan to hopefully fix and replace all current broken featuers and replace them with built in features or create static web pages where they won't go anywhere.
